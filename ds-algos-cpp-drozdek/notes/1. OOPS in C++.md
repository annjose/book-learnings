## Abstract Data Types
ADT is an item specified in terms of the operations that can be performed on it (instead of its structure). In C++, ADTs are implemented as a class.

Encapsulation - combining the data and related operations in a class. Class is template according to which an object is created.
Generics - Declare classes or functions using type parameters in the declaration. The class/function manifests itself depending on the specific declaration when used.

```
// Template class and usage
template<class T>
class MyClass {
	T items[50];
};

MyClass<int> intObject;
MyClass<float> floatObject;

// Template method
template<class T>
void swap(T& lhs, T& rhs) {
	T temp = lhs; lhs = rhs; rhs = temp;
}
int a = 10; int b = 20;
swap(a, b)

```

### What did I learn?

- how to configure Visual Studio code to compile C++ using clang that comes bundles with Xcode
	- install the C++ extension for VSCode as described here
-	configure clang++ to VSCode as described here
-	VStudio uses tasks.json to configure the compiler and build actions
-	VStudio uses launch.json to configure the debugger (Gotcha: prelaunchTask in the launch/json should match the name of the task in tasks.jspn)
-	Clang uses the extension .hpp instead of .h (if you .h, the compiler gives a warning that you are using regular c-style headers)## Abstract Data Types
